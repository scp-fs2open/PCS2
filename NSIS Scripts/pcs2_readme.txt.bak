2. What is PMF?
---------------------------------------------------
PMF is PCS Model File, it's POF Constructor Suite 2.0's internal model format.

It is a flexible model format that is easy to convert others into, and stores all the data needed for a .pof.

This makes it so that PCS2 only has to have one place in the entire code where any model format is converted to .pof.
All supported formats go through PMF as an intermediary and as the active model editor.
